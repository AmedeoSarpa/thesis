## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)? <br> Switching to an unique front end framework (MUI) was much long than expected.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  - Is important to communicate between front end and back end developer at the beginning of the implementation of the user story in order to not have doubt and know what one expects of the other.
