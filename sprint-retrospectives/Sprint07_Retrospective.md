## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)? 
  - The user story regarding the pagination was underestimated for us because we forgot about filters and took more time than expected because there were a lot of dependencies we did not spot.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - As already said in previous retrospectives, we should go more in deep when we discuss about stories, because we may forgot dependencies.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? <br>
  - Saurav well integrated in the team.
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?<br>
  - We did not fill a file with known bug but because we thought that the jira representation is enough.
  
- Improvement goals for the next sprint <br>
  - fix the front-end's pipeline, since sometimes fails even if in local all is ok.
  - update readme of repositories

  

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!<br>
  We very like the harmony with which we work and the way we communicate as we come from different countries.
