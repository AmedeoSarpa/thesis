## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)? <br> Even if we were able to terminate the sprint, we underestimated the spike story: "learn react query and apply to the project". We unexpected too much effort applying it to each requets to the Back end.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  - We must do sprint planning and effort estimation very carefully, because if we do, the sprint work is made easier and we have more possibility to complete the sprint.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? <br>
  We were able to complete the sprint. <br> We started doing code review in our own for small merge requests.
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?<br>
  We were able to achieve all goals.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint <br>

  - remove unused branch on repositories and manage better branch's creation
  - add excell file to keep track of the env variables, sharing these info between cloud developer and front/back end developer in order to improve team's velocity.

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!<br>
  We very like the harmony with which we work and the way we communicate as we come from different countries.
