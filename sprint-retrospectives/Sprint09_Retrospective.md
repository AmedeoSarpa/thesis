## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  - We did not take into account during the planning that during this sprint we have lose 3 days, one for French holiday and 2 for a UI/UX workshop
  - We did not balance well the work between front-end and back-end, there were committed to much stories including only back-end tasks.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  - We must pay more attention during the planning looking at the calendar, to check possibly days off or workshops.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? <br>
  - fix the front-end's pipeline, now we don't have more problems once we push on main.
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?<br>
  - update readme of repositories, because as already said, we had less time to work compared to a normal sprint, so we decided to focus more on stories implementation.
- Improvement goals for the next sprint <br>

  - not only for the next, but for all future sprints, check the calendar during the planning.
  - better manage git branch, not creating one branch per story but one branch per subtask if possible.
  - not create a user stories for each feedback given by the stakeholders but try to group togheter 
 

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!<br>
  We very like the harmony with which we work and the way we communicate as we come from different countries.
