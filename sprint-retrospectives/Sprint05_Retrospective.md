## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)? <br> Even if we were able to terminate the sprint, we underestimated the story: "print notification". During the planning we forgot that the use of notification back end requires the utilitation of a new protocol, the gRPC.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  - During the planning, we should go more in depth and consult also the C4 model taking in consideration the architecture.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? <br>
  We better manage gitlab's branch and we did more often merge request.
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?<br>
  We still do not use the excell file to keep track of the env variables, probably because the team member that manage cloud is the same that has put the env variable in the code.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint <br>

  - try not to get to the day before the review with pressure and code not yet on the main
  - try to reduce the size of task in order to not have one task in progress for more than 3 days

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!<br>
  We very like the harmony with which we work and the way we communicate as we come from different countries.
