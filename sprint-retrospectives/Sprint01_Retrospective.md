## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)? <br> It was our first sprint and not all of us started with the same knowledge (like react or nestjs), we underestimated the fact that we would have to do some pair programming in order to have all the same knowledge about the technologies we use.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  - We learned that we should ask to the PO if we have doubt in some stories and not start coding without having a clear idea in mind.
  - We should define a GUI before starting implement the FrontEnd functionalities.
  - Pair programming is a very powerful technique so that all team members have the same knowledge.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? <br>
  None, since was the first sprint.
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?<br>
  None, since was the first sprint.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint <br>

  - define a GUI.
  - manage better task board, using same naming convention for subtask creation and keep it updated.

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!<br>
  We very like the harmony with which we work and the way we communicate as we come from different countries.
