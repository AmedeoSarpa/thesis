# thesis
In this repo I collect all useful information for my master's degree thesis.

### Folder structure
- correlation-coefficient: script that computes the correlation coefficient between story bad estimated and three variables individuated as possible indicator for bad estimated stories.
- feedback-timesheets: Each file contains for each sprint info regarding the effort in hours for each story, if the story was under/over estimated for the team and possibly reasons why.
- metric-proposal: proposal of metric collected, with a schema of the process.
- sprint-retrospectives: sprint-retrospective per sprint
- variance chart: script that computes and print the variance chart
